Day Twelve // 30 days of React challenge // "Random Person Generator" with API

Today i've connected to an API in the lifecycle method componentDidMount, to grate a random person generator with https://randomuser.me/

Follow me *programming noob* as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned.

By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!

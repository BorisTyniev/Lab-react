**Day Twelve - 30 days of React challenge - "Random Person Generator" with API**

Today i've connected to an API within the lifecycle method componentDidMount, to create a random person generator with https://randomuser.me/

**Concepts Explored:**
- Fetch with React
- Loading data with componentDidMount

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
